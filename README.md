# Declaration for responsible and intelligent data practice

The Declaration is a co-designed shared vision for what good practice in data looks like. It is an ongoing co-design process and although some of the language is specific to Greater Manchester it is an open access document that can be adapted, adopted and implemented by others who see its relevance.

At present 14th October 2020 the Declaration is at version 1.0, and we are in the process of designing the governance system to enable its principles to remain relevant and the implementation framework to help organisations align with its intent.
