# What is the Declaration?

The Declaration was created through a collaborative and deliberative process. It offers a common vision for what best practice in data for Greater Manchester, and everywhere, should look like and was co-designed with the generous support and expertise of practitioners from public, private, academic, civil-society and voluntary organisations.

It’s aim is to act not only as a statement of intent, but also as a means for developing and maintaining best practice in data, and although it was designed to be implemented in Greater Manchester the input and support from the wider data community means that its principles are not geographically constrained and are available to be adpated, adopted and implemented by others.

Its aim is to act not only as a statement of intent, like the ‘first do no harm’ principle found in medical ethics, but also as a means for developing and maintaining best practice. 

It is, therefore, meant to be practical and pragmatic, as well as living and dynamic, given that the world, just as the world of data, is complex, and data practice is constantly evolving with new challenges and opportunities.

The principles of the Declaration will be ‘made real’ using an implementation framework that helps organisations access resources that will enable them to adopt and maintain best practice. 

A new governance structure will be created to ensure that the Declaration evolves as practice changes in the face of a changing world.

With your help, by 2025, we can make Greater Manchester a place where responsible and intelligent data practice is part of what it means to live and work here.

We welcome comments as to how the Declaration could be improved so please contact Julian or Sam on declaration@opendatamanchester.org.uk
